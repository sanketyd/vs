In present year our focus is to apply the concepts of Swami Vivekananda in our daily life through some practical activity for a overall IIT-K community as well as to take active part in nation building.
        </p>

                We have conducted a plethora of events like talks on Vendanta, ancient India, Sanskrit Language and permaculture, special lecture on self-belief exercise and Spoken Sanskrit Language, social Services like Health Camps around the campus. Weekly discussions on Swami Vivekananda's life and teachings, Vendata class, Sanskrit class, meditation session and distribution of Vivekananda literature among youth were also conducted.

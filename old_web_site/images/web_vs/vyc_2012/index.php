			<p style="font-size:1.1em">More than a century ago, a man dared to travel half the globe round to represent his faith at Parliament of World's Religion in Chicago. He went Without an invitation letter and was refused to enter the premises. The Man without appropriate clothing and shelter spent a night in a cardboard box at a railway station, still holding a smile on his face as he had tremendous determination and faith in himself. It was this very man who later shook the whole of America and then Europe with his overarching knowledge, faith and determination to harmonize the world by giving the West the message of spirituality and bringing in material help for his own motherland, India.</p>

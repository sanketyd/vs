The recent DNA studies have revealed that after origin in Africa, a small
group of Individuals reached India in about 85,000 years before present,
then early human expansion occurred in India from where rest of the world
was populated. Even majority of the African humanity has genetically
descended from this earliest Indian genetic stock. In year 74,000 Before
Present, the Mount Toba eruption destroyed all human beings except about
1000 persons in India and 10,000 in Africa.</p>
<br>
<p>
The period was marked by glacier (74,000-65,000 years back and
20,000-16,000 ybp) and inter-glacier periods. Every time glaciations
occurred, it restricted the human populations to the warmer regions like
India, equatorial Africa and the Southeast Asia. But when the globe warmed
again, human population expanded to reach the northern regions. During all
these expansion events, India played a crucial role in dissipation of man,
language and culture to the world. The DNA studies also found that the
Indians of today have not arrived from anywhere else, but have descended
from the original human stock of the 85,000 years back. The Dravidian,
Indo-European, and other languages of India are all indigenous in their
respective locations of the sub-continent. On the other hand, the
Europeans have reached there from India over the last 12,000 years or so.
Not only this the genetic proof suggests that the Indians domesticated
cow, goat, sheep, horse and buffalo, as well as wheat, barley, rice and
pulses, which laid to the foundations of the modern civilization.

<b style="color:blue">About the Speaker:</b>
<b>Dr. P. Priyadarshi</b>, MBBS, MD, MRCP (UK), FRCP Edin is an accomplished
doctor, who has interests in history, philosophy, religions, anthropology,
political science and linguistics. He has authored books on Indology viz.
India’s Contributions to the West (2004), Zero is Not the Only Story
(2007), The First Civilization of the World (2011) and Vishva Sabhyata ka
Udbhava aur Prasar (2012).
 He has proved from the DNA studies that not only the Aryan and the
Draviadian Invasion theories are wrong, but actually the it was the
Indian population migration which produced the modern populations of
Europe, China and the Southeast Asia. Dr Priyadarshi has also written
articles and books on the ancient Indian science and their impact on
world. </p>

	<br>
	<p>
In the known history of human civilization , India comes up with very high
level of thought processes, their systematization and application.
Mathematics is one such area where in this subcontinent great developments
have taken place. The world indeed pays respect to Ancient  Indian minds
who came up with the positional place value system of representing large
numbers, gave zero a status same as other numbers and finally developed
decimal system.</p>
<p>Computing techniques are necessary to make further applications of the
basic mathematics. At the end of the day, we need to come up with numbers
which relate to the physical quantities. Developing efficient algorithms
for computing these numbers is an important task being followed by the
software professionals. Invention of computers has sped up the computing
but the requirements are going up at a higher scale and the importance of
coming up with better computing techniques is ever increasing.</p>
<p>Talk will be about the   following three aspects of computing in
Ancient India.</p>
<p>
1.        Computing algorithms given by Aryabhat (5th century) for finding
the square root and cube root of a number, computation of sine differences by
the same author for the angles 0 to 90 degree in steps of 3 deg 45 min,
and equation given by Bhaskar I (7th Century) to get sine of any angle
between 0 and 180 deg.</p>
<p>
2.        Binary number system used by Pingala (2nd Century BC), to
classify the meters of Sanskrit verses. The algorithms to convert a sequence 
formed by two symbols to a decimal number and inverse of that.</p>
<p>3.      Coding of alphabetic characters by numbers, known as Katapayaadi
scheme(7th century or before) and its uses in coding sequences of numbers
in terms on meaningful mnemonics and also to use the coded number to
efficiently search a value in a table (hashing).

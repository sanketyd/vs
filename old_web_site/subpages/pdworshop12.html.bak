<font  color="#660000">What makes the difference between an ordinary and an extraordinary person?</font>
</p>
<p>
It is the personality. Our personality determines our attitude and success
in life. Albert Einstein said "We should take care not to make the
intellect our God; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no
personality." Swami Vivekananda emphasized on developing strong
personality having muscles of iron and nerves of steel.

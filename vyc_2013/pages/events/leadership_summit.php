		Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King and Roosevelt were all great leaders. They influenced the world with their thoughts, actions and their leadership qualities. These great leaders may have died but they are still immortal in our thoughts. But what qualities did these guys have in them? There is a famous saying “LEADERS ARE NOT BORN, THEY ARE MADE” and to prove this point and encourage leadership in youth we have this event which will test the skills every leader should possess.

<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
	Vivekananda Samiti, under Students Gymkhana, on behalf of the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, has undertaken the celebration of 150th Birth Anniversary of Swami Vivekananda from 2011-2015. Significantly, being one of the oldest clubs under the Student Gymkhana, Vivekananda Samiti has humbly pursued the noble activity of motivating, encouraging, and enlightening young minds over a span of forty years. Conducting several activities which include community services such as awareness camps, health camps and clothes distribution drives for the under-privileged section of the community, weekly discussions on Vedanta and Swami Vivekanandaâ€™s life and teachings, Sanskrit learning classes, invited talks and workshops on various fascinating and relevant subjects, the Samiti has continually endeavored to reinvigorate the causes of social welfare. Befitting such auspicious aims, and given the legacy of the Youth Conventions held in the month of January 2011 and 2012, the Samiti aspires to conduct the  <b>Vivekananda Youth Leadership Convention</b> at IIT Kanpur, from <b>10<sup>th</sup></b> to <b>16<sup>th</sup> January 2013</b>.

	Following this weeklong Convention in January, we plan to continue the celebration of the 150th Birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda through a series of activities throughout the year 2013. This will include <b>Vivekananda Lecture and Workshop Series 2013</b>. Through this lecture and workshop series  we intend to hold invited talks by eminent speakers and a set of workshops on subjects like personality development, leadership and social innovatiom, technology and ethics, stress-free living and sustainable society and environment. The talks will focus on subjects such as Indian culture, philosophy, education, social entrepreneurship and social innovation. These speakers, by sharing their experiences and knowledge will show a career path, a way of life which contributes to both individual and social growth.

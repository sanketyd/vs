						<b>Rimpa Shiva</b>, born in 1986 at Kolkata, has been blowing away audiences all over the world with her amazing Tabla playing. She is renowned for her incredible speed and control. She simply lives and breathes Tabla and her performances exhibit magnificent control, artistry, speed and power.  
					</p>
					<p>
						From the age of <b>three</b>, Rimpa showed keen interest in playing with the Tabla instead of dolls, pots and pans like other children of her age. Thus, from early childhood, she started receiving lessons from her father and guru Prof. Swapan Siva, disciple of the Late <b>Ustad Keramatullah Khan</b> of <b>"Farukhabad Gharana"</b>.

But naturally, numerous awards and honours have come her way: she has received scholarships from the <b>Salt Lake Music Festival</b> and the West Bengal State Music Academy in 1995 and was awarded the Shanmukha Sangeet Shiromani in 2004 in Mumbai. As a child prodigy, she was the subject of an eponymous French documentary film <b>"Rimpa Siva, Princess of Tablas"</b> in 1998.

				<p>Our nation has a diverse heritage. Unity in diversity is the spirit embedded in the psyche of all the citizens of our country. Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur is one those institutions which has glorified history for having people coming from different states across India and contributing to the institute and to our nation. “<b>Vaividhya Bharata</b>” is an event by IITians which celebrates this notion of unity in diversity.</p>
				<p>
				People native to different states will be given a platform to give a performance for 5 to 10 minutes. The performance should represent the heritage of some part of our nation and it can include music, dance form, drama, attire presentation, art form demonstration etc. 
				</p>
				<p>This is a great opportunity to all IITians to share the culture of the place they belong to with their friends and also to learn more about our diverse nation.
